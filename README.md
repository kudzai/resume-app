A résumé is not a list of every job you ever had. It is not your autobiography. It is, like that hair-care advert, a marketing tool. Your audience is made up of recruiters and hiring managers. Like cocktail-party guests, they do not take a long time to decide if they want to keep talking. According to one study, such professionals spend an average of 7.4 seconds skimming a job application. Your guest Bartleby has a few tips on how best to ensure that these seconds count.

Decision:

I think there may be a mistake here. The screening criteria "Ability to own the whole ML life cycle" doesn\'t seem to be relevant to the job description, which is for a Strategy Consulting Team Leader role in the Financial Services sector.\n\nHowever, I\'ll review the resume and job description based on the job description\'s requirements.\n\n{\n    "decision": "pass",\n    "reason": "The resume shows deep Financial Services sector experience, management of consulting engagements, development and implementation of business strategies, and leadership of post-M&A integration processes, which aligns with the job description\'s requirements. The candidate also has an MBA from a top-tier institution (Wharton) and a proven track record of delivering high-impact results."\n}
